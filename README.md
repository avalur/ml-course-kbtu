**Course duration:** 45 classroom hours, 15 weeks: 3 hours a week

**Course objectives:**
The course introduces the concepts and techniques in machine learning and deep learning. The course will first introduce basics of machine learning such as statistical learning models, linear and logistic regression, SVM, Bayes classifier and ensemble. The course will then introduce the basics of deep learning which include multi-layer neural networks, stochastic gradient descent, backpropagation, and optimization techniques. It will also cover topics which include recurrent neural networks, convolutional neural networks, generative networks, NLP and deep reinforcement learning. Coursework will consist of a few programming assignments and a final project in Python and PyTorch.

**Knowledge:**

 - Understand basic concepts of machine learning and deep learning.
 - Understand several types of machine and deep learning such as logistic regression, SVM, CNN, RNN, Attentions, GAN, DQN and their applications
 - Acquire a working knowledge of implementing and training machine learning systems

**Skills:** Implement machine learning/deep learning applications using Python and
PyTorch

### Homework and Programming Assignments
Students are encouraged to discuss assignments with other students, both to share high-level understanding of the design or basic utilities, However, coding and writing of Homeworks must be done individually or by a team submitting as a group.
