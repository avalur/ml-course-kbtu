### Image classification

  Competition on the Kaggle platform, the so-called InClass-competition, that is, for a study group, without overall rating points on the platform. Join via the link:

  The points for this task are distributed as follows:

  * 2 points for overcoming base_solution
  * 2 points for overcoming sol2 (4 in total)
  * 2 points for overcoming sol3 (6 in total)
  * 2 points for overcoming sol6 (total 8)
  * 8 points for clear code in a notebook
  * 8 points can be obtained for the completeness of the experiments. You are expected to try several convolutional network architectures with different parameters, maybe make an ensemble. The competition will last a little over a month until November 30, you can see the exact end time on the Kaggle.

  About bonus points for prizes:

  1st place +25 points, 2nd place +15 points, 3rd place +10 points.

  4-10 places +5 points.

  Submit the accompanying code/text in the comments to the task on the Teams.
